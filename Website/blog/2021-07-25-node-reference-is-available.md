As planned for some time, a [node reference](/docs/Nodes/Nodes/ReferenceStructure) is now available!

![Node Doc Example](images/NodeDocExample.gif)

This new set of documentation entries describe the available node operations you can use in Sceelix. Their usage, structure and organization is described in the [node introductory section](/docs/Nodes/NodeOverview), so make sure to read it first.

The process has been automated in the sense that each node page is generated from its code (and respective code comments). This means that future releases should always be accompanied by an update to the docs in a consistent manner.

Hopefully, this novelty will shed some better light on how to use Sceelix. 

More is to come!
