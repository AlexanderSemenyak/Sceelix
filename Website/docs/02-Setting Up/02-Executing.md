# Executing Sceelix

Once you have installed or unpacked Sceelix, start Sceelix:
* Windows: From one of its shortcuts or through the `Sceelix.exe` file in the installed folder.
* MacOS: From one of its shortcuts or from the `Sceelix` application package.
* Linux: From one of its shortcuts or through the `Sceelix.sh` file in the installed folder.

If everything goes well (if not, look [at this section](Installation)), you should be faced with the loading screen:

This process might take a few seconds, during which Sceelix will be loading all its libraries and plugins, after which the main screen should appear:
