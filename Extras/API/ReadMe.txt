API Samples
Author: Sceelix
==================================

In this folder you'll find samples on how to use Sceelix's API:

1. Sceelix.MyNewEngineLibrary
	Shows how to develop plugins to the Sceelix Engine, such as 
	new procedures, functions, entities and other features.

2. Sceelix.MyExternalApplication
	Shows how to use the Sceelix Engine Libraries from an external application.
	With this, you could load and execute graphs and use them inside your
	own projects, such as games, so as to achieve load and runtime procedural
	generation.
	
3. Visual Studio
	Contains visual studio templates for Sceelix procedures, such as to ease their 
	creation. Should be placed in Visual Studio's default template folder (usually
	in the user Documents/Visual Studio 20XX folder).
