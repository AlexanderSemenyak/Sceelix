# Image Viewer

The image viewer is one of the available file viewers. It is displayed inside the [Document Area](DocumentArea) and handles files with the **.jpg**,**.jpeg**,**.bmp**, and **.png** extensions.

At the moment, this viewer provides only a simple interface for displaying images without leaving the designer.
