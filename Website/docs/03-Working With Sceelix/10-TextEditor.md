# Text Editor

The text editor is one of the available file editors. It is displayed inside the [Document Area](DocumentArea) and handles files with the **.txt**, **.xml**,**.json**,**.ini** and **.csv** extensions. 

It is also the default file viewer for all other extensions, if no other specific handler exists.

At the moment, this editor provides only a simple interface for viewing and editing text files. Its main purpose is to provide a quick access to read/write notes and documents without leaving the designer.
